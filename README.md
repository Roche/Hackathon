# S2EA Hackathon 2019

Welcome everyone, this is the document with the rules and steps to make this hackathon as painless as possible. 

## RULES - Have fun!

The idea of a Hackathon is to put your knowledge to test and try to build something in a short period of time. 

The objective of this Hackathon is to create a slack bot in the S2EA slack. Our proposal is for you to create a simple API and deploy it in Heroku, but if you prefer to deploy it somewhere else, feel free to do it.

What kind of application can we do?

We would suggest you to try to do a simple but interesting project about how to improve your and/or the team day to day, here are some examples, but creativity will be evaluated!!:
* Agile tools (standup, retrospective, etc)
* Productivity tools (agenda, timers...)
* â€¦

Now go!!! Find a team and come back to read the rest of the document!

## STEP 0 - Slack

First of all and most important of all, please join the S2EA Slack group that we have created here: https://S2EA.slack.com access is open to anyone with Roche.com account.

Daniel Butnaru and Luis Ibanez will be available in there for any question until the Hackathon finishes. And you also have the #hackathon channel where we will publish all information about the hackathon.

## STEP 1 - Inscribe your team
Access to this document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UN9WjySlMDraLMY1AwLxOf5nsBTN4kGRy9ZWa60Efhs/edit?usp=sharing

And add the information about your team components:

Team name
Team components
Team admin - For admin permission in the slack (this will be needed to release the bot)

## STEP 2 - Hackathon repo
We have created a repository in Github to publish all the projects for the Hackathon

Repo: https://github.com/Roche/hackathon

You need to contact Luis Ibanez (via Slack) and send him the usernames of the users of the team that needs access, and the name of the team.

This repo also includes a sample slack bot done for this occasion that you can fork to start quickly. If you have any questions about this bot or need any help, contact Luis Ibanez.  

The final version of your app will have to be published in this repo before the Friday presentation.


## STEP 3 - Parallel computing
During a Hackathon there is not much time, so organization is very important, make a high level grouping of functionality and divide work!. Leave someone working on the bot structure, making the integrations and having the sample working while the rest think in an idea. Once is clear divide the functionality to be more efficient. Here you have some documentation that will be very important:

Sample Bot App:

Heroku: https://devcenter.heroku.com

Slack API: https://api.slack.com/start/overview

## STEP 4 - Do not lose time
Time is a scarce resource, come on!! Stop reading and start coding!! I see you on the hackathon closing session on Friday! :)
